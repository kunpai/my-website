To support this, we introduce a new dataset of coupled changes to code and documentation mined from high-quality GitHub projects, where each sample represents a single commit with simultaneous updates to code and docstrings. This dataset enables training and evaluation on realistic, change-related tasks, which remain challenging for current models like Llama 3.1 405B and Mixtral 8Ã—22B.",

This paper introduces a framework to evaluate and improve the calibration of code-generating models, finding that these models are generally poorly calibrated initially but can be improved using methods like Platt scaling, thereby enhancing decision-making in software engineering.",
