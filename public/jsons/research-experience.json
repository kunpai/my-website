        "description": "Built an automated pipeline for C-to-Rust transpilation using LLMs, with 5 prompt variations, targeting secure systems migration.\\nIdentified Halstead vocabulary as the strongest metric for predicting translation difficulty.\\nValidated lightweight semantic augmentations (e.g., filename context) that improved functional accuracy by 5%.\\nBenchmarked state-of-the-art LLMs across 746 C/C++ programs, achieving 70.2% functional accuracy with best prompt design.\\nIntroduced a cross-layer analysis framework combining compiler-level metrics with hardware performance counters for C vs. Rust translations.\\nExposed semantic and optimization gaps in LLM-translated and syntax-directed Rust translations.",
